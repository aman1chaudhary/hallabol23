                    <h2>Disc Passing Rules:</h2>
                </div>
                <ul className='guidlines'>

                    <li>On the first throw of the game or on a throw after any goal scored, a defense player cannot possess the Frisbee disc on first flight. Even if the Frisbee disc touches the ground, the offense gets the first possession.</li>
                    <li> The Frisbee can be passed in any direction.</li>
                    <li> If the Frisbee disc goes beyond the borders on the field, it is considered an outside and
                        the possession switches. If a player drops the Frisbee disc, possession switches.</li>
                    <li>A defense player has to maintain a minimum distance equivalent to an arm's length from the offense player in possession of the Frisbee disc. If the defense player fails to do so, it will be considered a foul.</li>
                    <li> An offensive player is not allowed to run from the position where he/she caught the Frisbee disc and is still in possession of the Frisbee disc. If the offense player does so, it will be considered a foul.</li>
                    <li> An Offense player has only 10 seconds to throw the disc. If the offense player fails to do so, possession will be exchanged.</li>
                    <li>If a defense player taps the disc while it is in flight, the possession switches, and the defense becomes the offense and vice-versa.</li>
                    <li> If a defense player taps the disc while it is in the hands of an offensive player, it is a defensive foul and he must restart his count from 1.</li>
                    <li> If a defense player during the defense doesn't clearly count 10 seconds then the offense player can hold the frisbee even longer than 10 seconds without committing a foul.</li>
                    <li>In case of any of the foul mentioned above, the possession switches immediately to the opposite team.</li>
                    <li> If a player commits 3 fouls, he/she is out of the game for the entire 30 minutes.</li>
