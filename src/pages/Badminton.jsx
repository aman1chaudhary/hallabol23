                        <li>There will be 4 players in each team.</li>
                        <li>If there’s a non-pool girl in the team they would get an additional advantage of 4 points
                            (i.e the game would start from 4-0) and if there are two or more girls in the team, the
                            team would receive an advantage of 7 points (ie, the game would start from 7-0).</li>
                            <li>Two or more pool players can not be in a team. A male pool player must include at
                                least 1 non-pool girl. If a male pool player is present in the team then the team will not
                                get any advantage of the girl player/players.</li>
                            <li>A girl pool player does not need to include a non-pool girl player. Also, a girl pool player
                                will not get any advantage because of herself. However, if she includes a non-pool player
                                girl/girls then her team will get advantage due to girl player/players.</li>
